  <p>
    MeshLED is built for LED topologies with branches, intersections, loops, and custom geometry.
    The same LightGraph-powered logic runs in simulator and firmware, so behavior stays consistent
    from prototyping to live installation.

## System Flow

```text
Control Panel -> LightGraph Core -> Firmware Nodes -> LEDs
                         \-> Simulator (same engine)
```
